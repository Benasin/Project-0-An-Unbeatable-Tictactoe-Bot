# Project-0-An-Unbeatable-Tictactoe-Bot
## Description:
- This is the first project that I have created for REC members: **An Unbeatable Tictactoe Bot**
- My purpose for creating this project is to enhance your **python coding skills** and get you familiar with **AI** and **game development**.
- The project's deadline will be at **11:59, 16/12**. 
- Anyone that finishs this project and pulls request to this github repository will have a special gift from me. To submit to this repo, please follow the instructions below.
- I hope that you will have a good time coding this project.
## Instructions:
- These are the instructions of this project that I recommned you to follow. Of course, you can implement the project other ways you want, but please follow the submission protocols.
-  To code the GUI for this **tictactoe** game, one of the best python module is **pygame**. If you don't know how to code this game with pygame, you can use this learning resource [Tictactoe Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc7XhHxSgrM&list=PLr-iRXN7HiJgJzMX22AVw4IU8ZOR4JS97)
-  To implement the **AI** in this project, you could use the **minimax alphabeta pruning algorithm**. Here are the links that you need for the algorithm:
   - [Minimax](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/minimax-algorithm-guide-how-to-create-an-unbeatable-ai/)
   - [Alphabeta Pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)
 - If you instead want use Reinforcement Learning or other methods to create the bot, it's fine by me, as long as you make the bot **unbeatable**.
 - For submission, please fork this repo, put all files you need in the folder with the path name is the name of yours, then pull request to this repo. The folder of your submission should be under the folder **Submission** in this repo. 
 - Please don't alternate any files in this repo except adding your folder to **Submission** folder.
 - I have created a sample **tictactoe bot** under the tictactoe folder. It's an executable file so your windows may warn against it, but it's okay, there is no virus in this file.
 - After the deadline, I will show you my source code and close this repo. If you want to have my gift, there are 3 requirements:
    - Your code must be clean with comment on each of its functions.
    - Do not using the kind of **if-else bot**.
    - Pull request to this file before the deadline.
 - This is the end of the instructions. If you have any questions, post it on discord. Happy coding.
